**Essay Questions** ADA Developer's Academy Application  
_________________________________________________  
#### 1. *Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?*  
I am a graduate of Utah State University where I studied physics with a medical emphasis. I love learning. I love working hard on challenging and rewarding projects and doing a job well. After earning my bachelors, I knew that I eventually wanted to further my education but wasn’t sure which path to follow.  
In my search, I shadowed physician’s assistants, dentists, doctors, and mechanical engineers. I interviewed pharmacists and biomedical engineers but I never felt like I had found my niche.  
After talking to a friend who works as a coder in Salt Lake City, I began considering web development. He told me that, although his studies had been challenging, the work was stimulating and rewarding. My interest was piqued! While researching further, I found that many of the companies I wanted to work with are looking for software engineers, and a multitude of creative, rousing opportunities are available in the industry.  
In January 2017, I attended a software development networking event organized specifically for women – the Xbox’s Girl Geek dinner. This event highlighted women who worked successfully in the tech industry. The speakers were impressive. The work they did was inventive and exciting. And the tech they presented was out of this world. I was hooked. The experience was the final push towards my newly decided career path.  
Prior to Xbox’s event, I had a small amount of experience with coding. While at Utah State University, I took Computer Methods in Physics. I also audited a beginners computer science class that taught C++ to learn the basics of coding language for my work with the Utah State University Material Physics Group. My research with this group afforded me the opportunity to work with programs such as Mathcad, Maple, and MATLAB, all of which had languages of their own. I also worked with a program called PuTTY, writing and running many “jobs” through the Utah State University Gaussian System.  
In February 2017, I applied to the 8th cohort of the Ada Developers Academy. The second phase of the application introduced me to Ruby, which I very much enjoyed. Following the application process, I was more determined than ever to learn valuable coding languages and work towards a career in the tech industry.  
I searched for introductory classes in the area and signed up for an 8 week Introduction to JavaScript class. The class was offered by Galvanize, a technology learning community with a base in Seattle. There I learned basic conditionals, loops, arrays, objects, functions, and jQuery commands. I also enrolled in a 12 week, hybrid HTML/CSS course offered by Galvanize, where I was introduced to common coding software, GitHub repositories, and the foundations of CSS and HTML (e.g. positioning, navigations, headers and footers, responsive CSS, etc.) Each of these classes required the completion of individual projects where I learned to implement my newly found knowledge.  
I am presently using Code Academy’s online intro courses to further my Ruby knowledge. I also plan to complete their additional intro courses which include Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and jQuery.  
  

#### 2. *If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?*  
The opportunities that the Northwest, particularly Seattle, presents to software engineers seems endless. I would love to work as a coder for a progressive company doing cutting-edge work. I have met coders working for large corporations such as Snapchat, Microsoft, and Amazon, as well as coders working for new innovative start-up companies. Both options sound fantastic and I know that experience will teach me which setup would be a better fit for me as an individual.  
Furthermore, I very much hope to be on my way to being an influential woman in the tech world. I feel like so much of an individual’s career decisions depend simply on what kind of options they are exposed to. I would love to use the skills and experiences I have gained to encourage young girls (My niece has joined a coding club in elementary school!) and other women to pursue careers in a field that at this time does not have a lot of female representation and which in the past has not offered a great deal of encouragement to women. The outreach event of Microsoft’s Xbox, especially the women of Xbox, helped me to decide to follow this course. I would love to do the same for others.   

#### 3. *After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?*  
Although my gender is not the only thing that defines me, I would be in a somewhat unique position as a female in a predominantly male environment. As tech companies make an effort to include people with different backgrounds and perspectives, I would love the opportunity to be a part of that type of enlightened, forward looking team.  
We live in an ever increasingly technical world. Most people rely heavily on the internet, smart phones, apps, etc. I use technology constantly. I use it to get around, to track traffic, to communicate with my loved ones, to share and connect with friends, to express myself creatively, for learning opportunities, for entertainment, and so much more. The coders of today are going to shape the next generation of programs. For tech products to appeal to and best serve all of the broad population, the people working in the tech industry should be a better representation of the population.  
Presenting the same challenges to people with different backgrounds and experience will produce a larger variety of creative results. Educating people with a variety of backgrounds and thought processes allows for more innovation in a field offering endless possibilities.  
I have a broad background of interests and experiences that I will bring to the coding world. I love participating in sports and have competed in many different areas – soccer is my favorite! I enjoy hiking, climbing, and biking. I have played piano since I was seven years old, and I have sung in many different choirs since I was a young girl. I love to read anything from fantasy to biographies to classic literature. My favorite class in college was the Philosophy of Mythology and Fairytales. We spent the entire second half of the semester discussing J. R. R. Tolkien. I love watching movies and have a special fondness for musicals and action movies. I also enjoy drawing. I will offer a unique perspective, and I relish the idea of working with others who have different backgrounds and outlooks than my own. I enjoy connecting and working with others in a meaningful and creative way and see coding as a way to do so.  

#### 4. *Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?*  
This summer, I took a humanitarian trip to Haiti. I was seeking a way to simultaneously reach out to others and have an adventure outside my native land. I joined a group that was working with an organization called Haiti Health Initiative. [HHI](http://haitihealthinitiative.org/ "Check out their webpage here!") is a wonderful organization, and I am happy to be involved with it. The group I was traveling with, however, was unprepared and disorganized. I should have seen this early on. In the end, the trip did accomplish many things, but it was less of a success than it could have been and a much bigger hassle than it should have been. I learned that, next time, a trip like that deserved a lot more research. Basically, I didn’t do my homework.  
The people who introduced me to the group were fun and exciting. The general layout of the trip and the projects it would entail sounded worthwhile and like something I could effectively contribute to. I heard the bare details and, a week later, signed up for the entire trip. Headstrong when it came to this trip, I ignored suggestions to conduct more research and talk to upper-level board members before I had committed.  
A myriad of things went wrong. To start off, there was confusion on who was responsible for the arrangements the trip required. The person who seemed to be in charge dropped out and was confused at the team’s consternation, as he thought someone else was heading that aspect of the trip. Meanwhile, the young woman put in charge in his stead desperately did not want to take on that role; she was studying for college finals and felt she hadn’t signed up for that extensive of a commitment. It was a confusing and rough start! As a result transportation, food, security, and other important details were not in place for our scheduled departure date. Finally the head of HHI stepped in, and with an expensive plane ticket change for everyone involved, the necessary arrangements were made and we headed out two weeks later.  
Our troubles did not stop there. The Health Care Workers, school children, school teachers, and others we were working with had prepared for our planned earlier arrival. Schedules had to be rearranged, and not all were able to interact with us according to the original plan. Money was argued over, and some money, along with other items, was misplaced. Overall, I did not leave feeling like I had dedicated my time and resources in the most positive way for me or the people I wanted to serve.  
That said, I would not unmake this imprudent decision or undo this hectic experience. I learned a lot about HHI and the good ways in which people are reaching out to each other across the world. I learned how much I loved accomplishing goals that benefitted not only myself but others as well. Living briefly in a new country where people mostly spoke a language I did not understand taught me about myself, and it was a great time for self-reflection. I met many wonderful and admirable people who enriched my life and with whom I hope to remain friends for a long time. In addition, I remain involved with HHI today (in a much more structured fashion), and my work with the organization brings me a lot of fulfillment and happiness and presents plenty of opportunities for learning and growth.  
Nevertheless, the next time I take a trip out of the country with a group, I will not jump in with such reckless abandon. I have learned the practicality of adequately researching an important undertaking before dedicating time, energy and money to it. I have also learned the value of getting information from multiple sources and not just, for example, from a very enthusiastic group of young people. I learned that lack of preparation can hurt not only you but affect other people who are depending on you. All in all, I am grateful for the experience and the lessons it taught me – especially for the way its failures and mishaps will guide my future endeavors.
